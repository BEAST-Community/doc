## What is BEAST?

BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences using MCMC. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability. We include a simple to use user-interface program for setting up standard analyses and a suit of programs for analysing the results. 

This website is for BEAST v1.X (currently version v1.8.4). For details about BEAST v2 please look here.

What can BEAST do?

## Getting started with BEAST

### Downloading BEAST

* [Install BEAST on Mac][beast_install_on_mac]
* [Install BEAST on Windows][beast_install_on_windows]
* [Install BEAST on UNIX/Linux or Mac command-line][beast_install_on_unix]

### Introductory Tutorials

These tutorials use the graphical applications of BEAST to perform analyses using the provided example files:

Tutorial 1: Using sequences sampled at different points in time to estimate rates
Tutorial 2: Estimating the divergence time of a monophyletic group using a known mutation rate
And more Tutorials available.

Some downloadable packages containing tutorial worksheets and associated data. These are used in workshops and classes.
