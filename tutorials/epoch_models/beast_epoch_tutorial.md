## Epoch Model Tutorial

This tutorial describes how to extend BEAST XML files, such as generated by BEAUti, to include analyses under time-heterogeneous (epoch) models (see Bielejec et al., 2014).

### Introduction

In this tutorial we will show how to setup, run and analyse data with the epoch models described in Bielejec et al. (2014). 
We present an artificial example and describe the necessary steps to get an actual analysis up and running. 
Example files for this tutorial can be found here.

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that the user has a basic knowledge of the BEAST framework, knows how to generate an XML input file and can interpret basic output information of an MCMC run. 
BEAST runnables for all major platforms can be found here. 
You will need a Java runtime environment version 1.5 or greater to run the BEAST executable. 
Due to the computational intensity of the computations involved in the epoch model, the BEAGLE library also needs to be installed and used with the BEAST runs discussed here. 
See the BEAGLE website for details on how to install and use the BEAGLE library.
