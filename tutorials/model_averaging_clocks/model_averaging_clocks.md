## Bayesian model averaging (BMA) for uncorrelated relaxed clocks

{% include callout.html content='This tutorial provides an alternative to the model selection tutorials that are also available and requires to first have a look at the different types of clock models in BEAST: <a href="clocks">\'Molecular clock models\' tutorial</a>.' %}

In previous tutorials, we have described different model selection approaches to select the optimal model (out of a selection of available models) for a data set using marginal likelihood estimation.
We have discussed different techniques to estimate the marginal likelihood, by either using [path sampling and stepping-stone sampling](model_selection_1) or [using generalized stepping-stone sampling](model_selection_2).
Although quantifying the marginal likelihood of alternative models is invaluable when it relates to hypothesis testing, model selection and its search for a single best-fit model typically ignores uncertainty about the "correct" model specification and can lead to overconfident inferences (Hoeting et al. 1999). 
Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approaches have been proposed to explicitly address model uncertainty by forming a posterior distribution over a set of candidate models (Madigan and Raftery 1994). 
In general, BMA does not provide a method for identifying the most likely model within the candidate set of models, as the aim of BMA is often orthogonal to model selection efforts.

Li and Drummond (2012) have developed a BMA approach in which the candidate set includes a small number of relaxed molecular clock models in Bayesian phylogenetics. 
Such relaxed clock models present a useful method for removing the assumption of a strict molecular clock. 
As such, the rate on each branch of the tree is drawn independently and identically from an underlying rate distribution. 
The two most popular candidates for the rate distribution among branches are the uncorrelated exponential distribution and the uncorrelated lognormal distribution.
Apart from these two underlying distributions, BEAUti also offers an underlying gamma distribution to be used for the uncorrelated relaxed clock.

We refer to Lepage et al. (2007) and Baele et al. (2012, 2013) as examples for comparing different clock models to one another.

### Setting up Bayesian Model Averaging in BEAUti

After [importing a data set](first_tutorial), the Clocks panel in BEAUti allows you to specify a molecular clock for your analysis.
An overview of the available clock models can be found [here](clocks).

Upon selecting the BMA checkbox, the selected model will switch to an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock, to clarify that the BMA approach averages over a selection of uncorrelated relaxed clock models.
In other words, the strict clock, fixed local clock or random local clock models are not part of the mixture of models within BMA.

By default, BMA in BEAUti will add all available underlying distributions for the uncorrelated relaxed clock models into the BMA mixture.
Specifically, this includes the exponential, lognormal and gamma distributions.
In [the next section of this tutorial](#BMAXML), we show how to extend this selection by editing the XML file generated by BEAUti.
The following Prior panel then automatically contains suggestions for the prior distributions across all the clock paramaters within the BMA mixture.

Additionally, the corresponding transition kernels for proposing parameter updates and switching between clock models in the BMA mixture are automatically generated in the Operators panel.

Essentially, selecting the BMA option in the Clocks panel takes care of all the necessary settings within BEAUti.
It's of course possible to edit the prior distributions and the transition kernels at your own convenience.
