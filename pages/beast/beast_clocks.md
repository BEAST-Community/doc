## Molecular Clocks

BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences using MCMC. 
It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. 

Apart from a strict molecular clock, a variety of models for relaxing the molecular clock assumption have been developed and implemented in BEAST.
These are accessible in the 'Clocks' panel in BEAUti:

### Strict clock

A strict clock model assumes that every branch in a phylogenetic tree evolves according to the same evolutionary rate.
This is hence a 1-parameter model, the parameter of which represents the conversion rate between branch lengths and evolutionary time.

Upon selecting this model, a single parameter will be estimated and will be equipped with a proper CTMC reference prior (Ferreira and Suchard, 2008).

### Uncorrelated relaxed clock

### Fixed local clock

### Random local clock
