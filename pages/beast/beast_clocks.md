## Molecular Clocks

BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences using MCMC. 
It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. 

Apart from a strict molecular clock, a variety of models for relaxing the molecular clock assumption have been developed and implemented in BEAST.
These are accessible in the 'Clocks' pane in BEAUti:
